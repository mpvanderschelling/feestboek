Hi! I am Martin, 28 years old, originally from Breda (the Netherlands), and I'm a PhD candidate from Delft University of Technology! I am involved in music and have been playing the piano for several years in my cover band <a href="www.deklittenband.nl">De Klittenband</a>. Besides music, I also regularly participate in sports like field-hockey and soccer. Additionally, I go snowboarding annually in the French Alps. I also frequently visit my club Feyenoord to watch soccer games, supporting the most beautiful club in the Netherlands :).
